                        <h3>React Js</h3>
                        <p>React is a great language to build the view component in the application. Because we make individual components while using React, 
                            It makes it so flexible and reusable thus increasing the speed for the next project.
                            I have done couple of projects using React. And this web application is entirely made up of using React.</p>

                        <h3>Redux Js</h3>
                        <p>I always love using Redux with React and it goes so well. It is a great technology to manage data flow in the front end. It has a very good structure and makes it so easy to understand.
                            The reducers, action and store is cool about redux. I am currently using React and Redux to make a cool application in GADA technology.

                        <h3>Node JS</h3>
                        <p>Node Js is great language to work for back-end staff. Because it is based on the modular approach, it makes it so easy to reuse these module. And there are thousands of npm packages around there
                            which help a lot while doing a project.I have make couple of microservices using Node, Express and mongodb.

                        <h3>Docker</h3>
                        <p>Docker is the world's leading software container platform. Really, it is great to work with. In a big project where there are so many developers, docker makes it easy to 
                            provide the same platform to run the application so we don't have to worry about the platform that we are using.

                        <h3>Keycloak</h3>
                        <p> Keycloak is an open source Identity and Access Management solution amined for modern applicaion and services.
                            If we can provide a great security using Keycloak, why do we bother to write code for every project. It also has social login which is really handy for modern applications. </p>
